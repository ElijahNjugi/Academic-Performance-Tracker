# University Academic Performance Management System (UAPMS)

## Overview

The **University Academic Performance Management System (UAPMS)** is a web-based platform designed to help university students monitor, evaluate, and manage their academic progress throughout their academic journey. The system empowers students with personalized academic analytics, GPA tracking, degree classification projections, and actionable feedback. It also supports lecturers in understanding performance trends for early academic intervention.

## Features

- 📊 **GPA Calculation & Charts**  
  Automatically calculates semester and cumulative GPA, and visualizes trends using graphs.

- 📈 **Unit Performance Breakdown**  
  Displays passed and failed units per semester and calculates average unit scores.

- 🚨 **Smart Alerts**  
  Notifies students of core units that require retakes or may block progression.

- 🎓 **Degree Classification Projection**  
  Predicts final degree class (e.g., First Class, Second Upper) using institutional rules.

- 📌 **Academic Recommendations**  
  Provides students with next-step guidance: retakes, academic warnings, or progression eligibility.

- 🔐 **User Authentication**  
  Secure account management with login and protected dashboards.

## Target Users

- 🎓 **University Students:**  
  To self-monitor progress and plan retakes, goals, and course completion paths.

- 👨‍🏫 **Lecturers/Advisors:**  
  To access summarized student performance insights for guidance and academic support.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js  
- **Authentication:** Session-based or token-based (TBD)

## Development Approach

We are using an **Agile Scrum** methodology with sprint-based development and regular feedback cycles. Major sprints include:

1. Requirement analysis and wireframes
2. UI implementation (React + Chart.js)
3. Backend development (PHP + PostgreSQL)
4. Authentication and validation
5. Testing, feedback, and deployment
